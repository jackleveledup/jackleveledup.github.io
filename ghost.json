His primary conflict is that he doesn't know what he wants out of life. Yet somehow, there's nothing stopping him from becoming best buds with everyone he meets: classmates, children, superiors, even his enemies.

So why do his superiors overlook his aimlessness in life? Does Thors Military Academy not have career counseling? Self-esteem struggles are incredibly real to me, but it feels so overwhelmingly convenient that someone without an understanding of what they want from life would still be so admired by everyone he meets. \\n\\nIf Rean likes his work in Class VII, why wouldn't he at least try doing more of the same as a Bracer? \\n\\nRean's refusal to take responsibility is maddening. He's the student of a legendary sword master, one of two *in the world* chosen by fate to pilot a massive robot, a member of an extraordinary class of students at a prestigious military academy, and more than that, he's trusted as their leader. He has so many classmates looking up to him! He's so busy looking down on himself that he overlooks an entire world of opportunity in front of them. I'm sure I'm supposed to see this as tragic, but it's frustrating. \\n\\nThis story refuses to commit its antagonists to any kind of ideology. “Whose side are you really on,” you’ll wonder, as villains rub elbows with Rean and bring him a hamburger. \\n\\nBy giving the opposition this cozy, “will-they-won’t-they” familiarity, the stakes of the civil war are dramatically lowered. While it’s ostensibly a story of a civil war, death is not an object in play. Very early on, Rean’s hometown is set ablaze by the Noble faction, and his father even takes a bullet in the process. This dramatic scene gives the impression that he dies, but he’s up and out of bed hours later. Later, Elliot’s sister is held hostage in an attempt to bait her father into a disadvantageous position. The tension is high as you rush to her rescue, and she is saved without breaking a sweat. The main villain of the story, assassinated at the end of the previous game, miraculously appears alive.\\n\\nIt seems that these characters are incapable of loss. Maybe a sprawling web of heroics and budding friendships is enough - but it’s impossible for me to ignore how conveniently everything turns out. Death is not an object in play. Betrayals are justified with world building and plot twists. And Rean is incapable of making mistakes. Everything is going to work out eventually, as my eyes drift from the clock, to the plot, and back again.\\n\\nCS2 sends this story far enough off the rails that I’ve lost faith in their ability to bring it back.

The characters leveraged this conflict to express the value of empathy, and how a shared perspective (given enough time) can overcome nearly anything that divides us. While its characters were occassionally melodramatic and predictable, it conveyed this theme well enough that it pulled me through 80 hours of its rigid gameplay loop.

Before you judge me, though, you should know that\nit's probably the game's most obnoxious challenge: you have to outride an\naccelerating jump rope for at least 100 jumps. I mean, sure, in context, it's a\ncute mini game. Two formally-dressed denizens of New Donk City  are swinging a\njump rope in front of their office building, in broad daylight, and you're a\nfour-foot-tall cartoon man hopping in off the sidewalk.\n\n\"One hundred Mario jumps\" doesn't sound like a herculean feat or anything, but\nthere's no argument that it's difficult. I gave it only a few attempts before\ndeciding this wasn't a moon I cared about getting. I never once expected I would\nactually collect all 999 moons, and having to continuously restart this\nmini-game from zero was...trying, to say the least. In a year as packed with\nreleases as 2017, moving on (even from great games!) has become almost second\nnature.\n\nEarlier this week, obviously glitched clips of 10,000+ jump rope runs\n[https://twitter.com/FourScore64/status/932803217100075008]  caught fire on\nTwitter. Me being petty / apparently anxious to get my revenge on a mini game, I\ncouldn't help but look into it further. So here's how the glitch works: there's\na hint-offering bird named Talkatoo that appears in every world in the game. By\nsmacking Talkatoo with your hat, his animations can be manipulated to trick the\ngame into thinking you're talking to him when you're actually not. Since Mario\nand the camera lock in place while talking to another character, things start to\nget weird: you can manually lock the camera in unusual positions, freeze a few\nof Mario's animations, and in the right circumstances, trap him in place\nvertically. It's an unusual and generally harmless bug, but it's incredibly\nuseful  if you need to...I dunno, maybe suspend Mario in midair as a jump rope\nswings circles around him for a few minutes.\n\n\n\nThe \"Talkatoo glitch\" isn't something you would ever run into while casually\nplaying the game, but it's surprisingly easy to pull off. The tutorials\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZcbDGu6Ht4]  make it seem easy as far as\nexploits go, so I knew I had to at least give it a shot. In half an hour, I went\nfrom an ordinary player to an expert at this specific gimmick. Honestly, I think\nI spent less time earning most Power Moons legitimately...\n\nIt's hard to describe the utter joy I felt making such a polished game distort\nso delicately. I'm sure fans of speedruns are familiar with the exhilaration of\nseeing a new trick, skip, or promising new strategy. Executing this glitch felt\nkind of like that, I suppose, or at least what I imagine a speedrunner feels\nlike. It's this strange sort of enjoyment that feels almost inverted  from\nnormal play.

Instead, you can just think of this as a list of games that I found to be *exceptional* (in no particular order). Let's go!\\n\\n## Gravity Rush 2\\n![Gravity Rush 2's plucky heroine, Kat, overlooks the colorful tents of the street markets in Jirga Para Lhao](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1518663809/gravity-rush-2_mux6ue.jpg#full)\\n\\nIt's my belief that there's nothing more beautiful in video games than the marriage of story elements and gameplay. When a game establishes its themes and progresses its gameplay in tandem, it's possible to achieve something truly meaningful and affective; something so much more than simply entertainment. In its best moments, Gravity Rush 2 exemplifies such a level of synergy.\\n\\nThe game drops our plucky heroine, Kat, into the bustling markets of Jirga Para Lhao: a colorful, floating city amidst a sea of clouds. You could press your way through its packed alleys, but it's much more likely that you'll soar up and over them using Kat's ability to defy gravity. It's both charming and whimsical to float about such a place, accompanied by casual reggae guitar chords and brassy hooks.\\n\\nAfter just a few hours, it becomes apparent that this open world is far larger than it appears, and absolutely not in the way you'd expect. When a main-story mission sent me beyond the initial boundaries of the map, I was excited and ready to take on the open skies. I launched from the edge of the city and began to head towards a marker at the bottom of the screen. Distance is hard to judge in such an empty expanse, though, and the longer I fell, the more I started to wonder: the waypoint is right there, but am I actually going the right way? Why is this sector so impossibly far from the market? The answer to those questions hits like a punch to the gut, and it's so clever, so thematically perfect, that I wouldn't dare spoil it here. It's the rare moments like these that remind me why I fell in love with games to begin with.\\n\\n## Yakuza 0\\n![A young Yakuza outcast, Kazuma Kiryu, smokes a cigarette in front of a theater in the red light district of Kamurocho.](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1518663809/yakuza-zero_xnyspa.jpg#full)\\n\\nFrom the box art alone, you might expect this to be strictly a violent, bloody crime drama about a bunch of tough dudes with tattoos. While that is occasionally true, what I'll remember most about this game is how delicately it frames its protagonists, Kiryu and Majima. Despite being thrust into inconceivably shitty situations, they manage to endure it all as deeply genuine and sympathetic people, striving for nothing more than to do the right thing. Sometimes, that means risking their lives to stand up against malicious Yakuza conglomerates. Others, it means comforting the manager of a remote-control car racetrack, because some kids called him a virgin. No matter how intense, or how ludicrous a situation becomes, the narrative always finds a way to loop back to sincerity, and encouraging people to become *better*.\\n\\nBetween its gripping narrative and laidback Tokyo/Osaka simulation elements, Yakuza 0 tackles a baffling gamut of themes, ideas, and gameplay concepts. Somehow, it finds success in nearly all of them. It's rare that I feel as safe recommending a game as I do with Yakuza 0, and while it does have its missteps (particularly in how little agency it gives to its female characters), it teaches more valuable life lessons than I'm able to count.\\n\\n## Metroid: Samus Returns\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1518737571/Metroid-Samus-Returns_lie7p8.jpg#full)\\n\\nUntil September of 2017, Metroid was in the midst of a sour stretch that could *easily* have spelled death for a lesser series. Nintendo was bent on pivoting the series to seemingly anything else, perhaps in search of something easier to market than a desolate action thriller. Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, Spanish developers MercurySteam were busy taking creative liberties with Castlevania to increasingly [mixed critical reception](http://www.metacritic.com/search/all/castlevania%20lords%20of%20shadow/results). 2017 was a year of unprecedented events, but at least we can rest easy knowing that one of them was actually good: MercurySteam managed to lift the Metroid series out of its creative rut.\\n\\nIt's been said before, but \\\"Samus Returns\\\" couldn't be a more fitting name. While I have minor gripes with the repetition of its structure, the mechanical innovations in this game feel incredible. For the first time, Samus can freely aim in any direction (via the 3DS' analog stick), allowing for not only more precise aiming, but trickier enemy placement and movement. My favorite addition, though, was unleashing screen-clearing waves of bullets with the rapid-fire ability. Each of the game's other \\\"Aeion Abilities\\\" are fresh, inventive, and have clever uses for both combat and exploration. What more could you ask for from a Metroidvania? Samus was once again the capable, confident badass that we've always known her to be.\\n\\n## HQ\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1518735082/HQ_mislul.png#full)\\n\\nLast year was a near-daily torrent of terrible news and reasons to protest, mixed in with more calls to my political representatives than my friends and family. For context: I'm privileged enough to have a stable source of income, full citizenship, good health, and a support network. Nonetheless, it was a greater challenge of my mental fortitude than any I have lived through before - and I'm one of the lucky ones.\\n\\nSuch an environment became a strangely apt opportunity for HQ, a daily, live-streamed, rapid-fire trivia game for smartphones. The show's beloved host, Scott \\\"Quiz Khalifa\\\" Rogowsky, is a seemingly endless fount of enthusiasm. That energy drew me in like a parasite, and yes, I harvested the *shit* out of it. Those of us that struggle with mental health have come to learn that a single moment of positivity can often be the difference between a good day and a bad one, and HQ turned around so many of my bad days.\\n\\nLike Pokemon Go before it in 2016, HQ became both a cultural juggernaut and a keystone of my year. For months, my fiancée and I would drop anything we happened to be doing after dinner to play HQ. When I went to holiday get-togethers, I learned that HQ is exponentially more fun to play with more people. Everyone would huddle together to judge Scott's pop culture references, brainstorm, and panic when the questions inevitably got tough. By the way, here's an advanced tactic: make sure everyone turns their sound up, because the more echoes of Scott's obnoxious voice bounce around the room, the better you'll feel. Those shared experiences will be where my memory of HQ will have to stay, because...well, [recent events](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/feinberg-opinion-hq-trivia-peter-thiel_us_5a74918ae4b0905433b3c20b) have led me to uninstall!\\n\\n## Sonic Mania\\n![Sonic and Tails dash through the rocky desert in Mirage Saloon Zone](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1518663809/sonic-mania_k4q9pk.jpg#full)\\n\\nPhysics experts say that there are four fundamental forces in our universe: gravitation, electromagnetism, the weak force, and lastly, the strongest force of all: nostalgia. That statement ~~*is scientifically incorrect*~~ will never seem as true for any franchise as it has for Sonic these past several years. It couldn't have been an easy decision for the execs at Sega to hand their mascot and most prized property to a handful of fan-game developers. But to the fandom...? It was a win [from the moment it was announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98eoSTr8ips). \\n\\nThe summa cum laude Sonic fans at PagodaWest and Headcannon understand that Sonic isn't simply a game about \\\"going fast\\\" - it's a platform game at heart. Mania's numerous mechanics and gameplay gimmicks add color to the experience, making each stage memorable and uniquely challenging. Above all else, they provide opportunities to simply \\\"play,\\\" which seems shockingly refreshing for Sonic. Recent entries in the franchise, especially the 3D ones, appear to borrow inspiration from roller-coasters by relying on speed, anticipation, and release. Sonic Mania is not a roller-coaster, though, it's as *video game* as it gets.\\n\\nSonic Mania is designed with such a clear sense of purpose that the original trilogy might even fall short. Despite borrowing so many levels from previous games, Mania is not simply \\\"more\\\" Sonic, or Sonic \\\"as it was.\\\" It's a comfortable interpretation that resembles our precious childhood memories of the Sega Genesis, kissed by nostalgia and sweetened by time.\\n\\n## Night in the Woods\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1518663810/nitw_b3lj14.jpg#full)\\n\\nNight in the Woods feels, in many ways, created for a hyper-specific audience that I happen to fall into: one that fled the prideful, often bigoted atmosphere on Facebook to find seclusion and some modicum of \\\"safety\\\" on Twitter. Sidenote, so much for that plan, huh? To people like us, NitW's themes are all too real: depression, career and economic anxiety, the baby boomer / millenial generation gap, life and friendship after moving on from school, so on and so forth. It wears the guise of a cute and stylish game about animals, sure, but in reality, it's courageously political.\\n\\nMany of the games I loved in 2017 were, in one way or another, about either escaping or overcoming the ugliness of the world. This game makes for a curious exception: it's both inspiring and meaningful, but not out of any sense of optimism. It acts instead a call to action; a *dismal* reminder that our world is terrible, prejudiced, fearful, and difficult. It's on us to find our own coping mechanisms, because, well, we're going to need them.\\n\\n## NieR: Automata\\n![Combat android \\\"2B\\\" faces off against the \\\"enemy of mankind,\\\" the machines](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1518663810/nier-automata_cvokqg.jpg#full)\\n\\nUnless you spent 2017 passed out under a rock (totally understandable), you hopefully had at least one friend insisting that you *need* to play NieR: Automata. If you didn't get around to it, though, I can understand the aversion. It's...well, maybe an impossible game to parse? The gameplay is a fluid blend of various action genres, and its narrative is challenging from the get-go, overflowing with difficult questions about identity, purpose, and death. For better or worse, NieR: Automata is the kind of game that legitimately needs to be experienced firsthand to be understood. \\n\\nWithout spoiling anything, I can sing praise of its drop-dead gorgeous attack animations and stupendous, flamboyant sense of style. I can allude to its bonechilling soundtrack and its deeply considered *use* of that soundtrack. What I can't tell you is which characters, plot points, or sidequests will define your experience. Its a story with so many memorable moments (and sparingly, some subleties too) that its hard to predict quite how it will land with each player. It may seem that its grim, apparently nihilistic inclination is at odds with the tight action gameplay, but its precisely this combination that makes it such an interesting game. \\n\\nRegardless of *how* it hits, its message remains relatable - painfully so. Automata argues blatantly that human beings kinda' suck. We're inherently and unavoidably selfish, stubborn, irrational, misguided, and (truthfully) violent. Whether its through work, entertainment, play, or creativity, we spend our days seeking any form of solace from our mere existence. Even still, there's meaning to be found in the pursuit of a reality that's better. \\\"Trying\\\" leads to failure, and we're even prone to that outcome, but someday, we might accomplish something worthy of absolving our own mistakes. Glory to mankind.\\n\\n## Xenoblade 2\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1518663810/xenoblade-2_ptictj.jpg#full)\\n\\nLife is, at times, an impossible balancing act - we make things too complicated, we worry about situations out of our control, and we give in too quickly to our weaknesses. It can be easy, especially when we're hurt, to let our empathy slip and overlook the pain of others. It's at times like these, times like most of 2017, that we can thrive off of a clean and simple expression of hope. For me, Xenoblade 2 was exactly that, and what it may have lacked in complexity, it made up for in passion.\\n\\nThat said, I definitely was not prepared for Rex's utter exuberance. For a long time, his ceaseless enthusiasm and naiveté actually pissed me off. He was that obnoxious friend trying to drag me into something overwhelming, and I was the wallflower not wanting to be disturbed. Xenoblade 2, though, had a hell of a trick up its sleeve in Yasunori Mitsuda's incredible, emotionally-manipulative soundtrack. How could I stay bitter to Rex when his hot-blooded heroics were underscored time and time again by the soul-stirring melodies of [Counterattack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTNC1t6_MY4)? It was such a simple, stupid trick, but *they got me*.\\n\\nAs the plot progresses, Rex's positivity is put through its paces. He learns something many of us have already internalized: optimism alone is not enough to overcome life's greatest challenges. It's here that Rex truly begins to shine as a character. He doesn't concede an ounce of positivity to this painful truth, he *reinforces it* with motivation forged from the pain of those around him.\\n\\nMaybe we don't all need the type of \\\"wake up call\\\" that Xenoblade 2 has to offer, but I think that sense of simplicity still carries an important purpose. Rex may be naive, sometimes, but he's not *wrong*. Even if reality can make \\\"hope\\\" and \\\"empathy\\\" seem like distant platitudes, that's all the more reason to fight back, and do the more difficult task of finding ways to deliver hope to the people around us.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<p>It's an unusual problem, for me, at least, to have so much to say about so many games that I actually have to devise ways to contain my praise. 2017 was an incredible year for games, with such a wildly packed calendar of releases that I'll be surprised if its ever topped.

I've been proven wrong before, though!\n\nNow, by all means, this is not a complete list of everything I loved from last\nyear: you might be interested in my piece about games that deserved more\nattention [https://levelplusone.com/goty-2017-games-that-went-overlooked/], and\nI'll soon be posting a piece on my absolute favorite games of 2017. Instead, you\ncan just think of this as a list of games that I found to be exceptional  (in no\nparticular order). Let's go!\n\nGravity Rush 2\n\n\nIt's my belief that there's nothing more beautiful in video games than the\nmarriage of story elements and gameplay. When a game establishes its themes and\nprogresses its gameplay in tandem, it's possible to achieve something truly\nmeaningful and affective; something so much more than simply entertainment. In\nits best moments, Gravity Rush 2 exemplifies such a level of synergy.\n\nThe game drops our plucky heroine, Kat, into the bustling markets of Jirga Para\nLhao: a colorful, floating city amidst a sea of clouds. You could press your way\nthrough its packed alleys, but it's much more likely that you'll soar up and\nover them using Kat's ability to defy gravity. It's both charming and whimsical\nto float about such a place, accompanied by casual reggae guitar chords and\nbrassy hooks.\n\nAfter just a few hours, it becomes apparent that this open world is far larger\nthan it appears, and absolutely not in the way you'd expect. When a main-story\nmission sent me beyond the initial boundaries of the map, I was excited and\nready to take on the open skies. I launched from the edge of the city and began\nto head towards a marker at the bottom of the screen. Distance is hard to judge\nin such an empty expanse, though, and the longer I fell, the more I started to\nwonder: the waypoint is right there, but am I actually going the right way? Why\nis this sector so impossibly far from the market? The answer to those questions\nhits like a punch to the gut, and it's so clever, so thematically perfect, that\nI wouldn't dare spoil it here. It's the rare moments like these that remind me\nwhy I fell in love with games to begin with.\n\nYakuza 0\n\n\nFrom the box art alone, you might expect this to be strictly a violent, bloody\ncrime drama about a bunch of tough dudes with tattoos. While that is\noccasionally true, what I'll remember most about this game is how delicately it\nframes its protagonists, Kiryu and Majima. Despite being thrust into\ninconceivably shitty situations, they manage to endure it all as deeply genuine\nand sympathetic people, striving for nothing more than to do the right thing.\nSometimes, that means risking their lives to stand up against malicious Yakuza\nconglomerates. Others, it means comforting the manager of a remote-control car\nracetrack, because some kids called him a virgin. No matter how intense, or how\nludicrous a situation becomes, the narrative always finds a way to loop back to\nsincerity, and encouraging people to become better.\n\nBetween its gripping narrative and laidback Tokyo/Osaka simulation elements,\nYakuza 0 tackles a baffling gamut of themes, ideas, and gameplay concepts.\nSomehow, it finds success in nearly all of them. It's rare that I feel as safe\nrecommending a game as I do with Yakuza 0, and while it does have its missteps\n(particularly in how little agency it gives to its female characters), it\nteaches more valuable life lessons than I'm able to count.\n\nMetroid: Samus Returns\n\n\nUntil September of 2017, Metroid was in the midst of a sour stretch that could \neasily  have spelled death for a lesser series. Nintendo was bent on pivoting\nthe series to seemingly anything else, perhaps in search of something easier to\nmarket than a desolate action thriller. Meanwhile, on the other side of the\nglobe, Spanish developers MercurySteam were busy taking creative liberties with\nCastlevania to increasingly mixed critical reception\n[http://www.metacritic.com/search/all/castlevania%20lords%20of%20shadow/results]\n. 2017 was a year of unprecedented events, but at least we can rest easy knowing\nthat one of them was actually good: MercurySteam managed to lift the Metroid\nseries out of its creative rut.\n\nIt's been said before, but \"Samus Returns\" couldn't be a more fitting name.\nWhile I have minor gripes with the repetition of its structure, the mechanical\ninnovations in this game feel incredible. For the first time, Samus can freely\naim in any direction (via the 3DS' analog stick), allowing for not only more\nprecise aiming, but trickier enemy placement and movement. My favorite addition,\nthough, was unleashing screen-clearing waves of bullets with the rapid-fire\nability. Each of the game's other \"Aeion Abilities\" are fresh, inventive, and\nhave clever uses for both combat and exploration. What more could you ask for\nfrom a Metroidvania? Samus was once again the capable, confident badass that\nwe've always known her to be.\n\nHQ\n\n\nLast year was a near-daily torrent of terrible news and reasons to protest,\nmixed in with more calls to my political representatives than my friends and\nfamily. For context: I'm privileged enough to have a stable source of income,\nfull citizenship, good health, and a support network. Nonetheless, it was a\ngreater challenge of my mental fortitude than any I have lived through before -\nand I'm one of the lucky ones.\n\nSuch an environment became a strangely apt opportunity for HQ, a daily,\nlive-streamed, rapid-fire trivia game for smartphones. The show's beloved host,\nScott \"Quiz Khalifa\" Rogowsky, is a seemingly endless fount of enthusiasm. That\nenergy drew me in like a parasite, and yes, I harvested the shit  out of it.\nThose of us that struggle with mental health have come to learn that a single\nmoment of positivity can often be the difference between a good day and a bad\none, and HQ turned around so many of my bad days.\n\nLike Pokemon Go before it in 2016, HQ became both a cultural juggernaut and a\nkeystone of my year. For months, my fiancée and I would drop anything we\nhappened to be doing after dinner to play HQ. When I went to holiday\nget-togethers, I learned that HQ is exponentially more fun to play with more\npeople. Everyone would huddle together to judge Scott's pop culture references,\nbrainstorm, and panic when the questions inevitably got tough. By the way,\nhere's an advanced tactic: make sure everyone turns their sound up, because the\nmore echoes of Scott's obnoxious voice bounce around the room, the better you'll\nfeel. Those shared experiences will be where my memory of HQ will have to stay,\nbecause...well, recent events\n[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/feinberg-opinion-hq-trivia-peter-thiel_us_5a74918ae4b0905433b3c20b] \n have led me to uninstall!\n\nSonic Mania\n\n\nPhysics experts say that there are four fundamental forces in our universe:\ngravitation, electromagnetism, the weak force, and lastly, the strongest force\nof all: nostalgia. That statement is scientifically incorrect  will never seem\nas true for any franchise as it has for Sonic these past several years. It\ncouldn't have been an easy decision for the execs at Sega to hand their mascot\nand most prized property to a handful of fan-game developers. But to the\nfandom...? It was a win from the moment it was announced\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98eoSTr8ips].\n\nThe summa cum laude Sonic fans at PagodaWest and Headcannon understand that\nSonic isn't simply a game about \"going fast\" - it's a platform game at heart.\nMania's numerous mechanics and gameplay gimmicks add color to the experience,\nmaking each stage memorable and uniquely challenging. Above all else, they\nprovide opportunities to simply \"play,\" which seems shockingly refreshing for\nSonic. Recent entries in the franchise, especially the 3D ones, appear to borrow\ninspiration from roller-coasters by relying on speed, anticipation, and release.\nSonic Mania is not a roller-coaster, though, it's as video game  as it gets.\n\nSonic Mania is designed with such a clear sense of purpose that the original\ntrilogy might even fall short. Despite borrowing so many levels from previous\ngames, Mania is not simply \"more\" Sonic, or Sonic \"as it was.\" It's a\ncomfortable interpretation that resembles our precious childhood memories of the\nSega Genesis, kissed by nostalgia and sweetened by time.\n\nNight in the Woods\n\n\nNight in the Woods feels, in many ways, created for a hyper-specific audience\nthat I happen to fall into: one that fled the prideful, often bigoted atmosphere\non Facebook to find seclusion and some modicum of \"safety\" on Twitter. Sidenote,\nso much for that plan, huh? To people like us, NitW's themes are all too real:\ndepression, career and economic anxiety, the baby boomer / millenial generation\ngap, life and friendship after moving on from school, so on and so forth. It\nwears the guise of a cute and stylish game about animals, sure, but in reality,\nit's courageously political.\n\nMany of the games I loved in 2017 were, in one way or another, about either\nescaping or overcoming the ugliness of the world. This game makes for a curious\nexception: it's both inspiring and meaningful, but not out of any sense of\noptimism. It acts instead a call to action; a dismal  reminder that our world is\nterrible, prejudiced, fearful, and difficult. It's on us to find our own coping\nmechanisms, because, well, we're going to need them.\n\nNieR: Automata\n\n\nUnless you spent 2017 passed out under a rock (totally understandable), you\nhopefully had at least one friend insisting that you need  to play NieR:\nAutomata. If you didn't get around to it, though, I can understand the aversion.\nIt's...well, maybe an impossible game to parse?

There's not a Monopoly board yet, but don't worry, [they're working on it](https://www.polygon.com/2016/6/29/12059956/final-fantasy-7-monopoly-remake)!\\n\\nIf there's any justice in this world, it's only a matter of time until an actual **\\\"Final Fantasy Warriors\\\"** game comes to fruition. At the very least, it wouldn't be the worst thing they've done with the franchise! The thought of such a game popped into my head last night, so for fun, I let my mind run wild on the concept. Here's my best attempt at narrowing the *many* possibilities to a small, varied, and representative lineup of characters I would love to see:\\n\\n## Cloud (FF7)\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1514694146/Cloud_dphyw4.jpg#full)\\n\\nI mean, this was never even up for debate. There is not a universe in the space-time continuum that has a Final Fantasy Warriors game, so there definitely isn't one without Cloud. It's even tempting to stop this list right here and come up with an entire roster of characters from Final Fantasy 7, because that would make one hell of a video game. I'm trying to keep this realistic, though!\\n\\n## Warrior of Light (FF)\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1514694146/WarriorOfLight_e03fez.jpg#full)\\n\\nNever forget your roots, they say. As typical as his moveset might end up being, this characterization of the original Final Fantasy's warrior archetype feels too classic to be left out. We can (and maybe should) play it safe with a few spots on our list.\\n\\n## Cecil (FF4)\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1514694146/Cecil_vxp6vu.jpg#full)\\n\\nBetween his white magic, dark sword arts, heavy armor, and flowing white hair, you know we need to have Cecil in this game. Square Enix's art team have done an incredible job of adapting Yoshitaka Amano's original design into 3D, so it would almost be a waste to *not* toss those assets right into a buckwild action brawler.\\n\\n## Rydia (FF4)\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1514694146/Rydia_ovmlfo.jpg#full)\\n\\nRydia is one of the series' earliest examples of strong female characterization, and if only for that reason alone, she would deserve a spot in the game. As a summoner, though, there are a lot of different ways they could go with her. Her entire moveset could be based around her partnership with the Mist Dragon, or maybe she would call in various summons for each combo. It doesn't really matter to me, I'd be down!\\n\\n## Bartz & Boco (FF5)\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1514694890/BartzBoco_el6mqq.jpg#full)\\n\\nWe have to put a chocobo in somewhere, right? These games tend to have characters on horseback, dragonback, or whatever else, and I can't think of anyone better suited to that idea than Bartz. To be fair, Bartz isn't the most compelling on his own, but as long as he has a combo finisher where he gives Boco a nice pat, he'll be worth having around.\\n\\n## Terra (FF6)\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1514694146/Terra_alh6pv.jpg#full)\\n\\nHopefully, you're already nodding along as to why Terra would be a good pick. She's (ostensibly) the protagonist of one of the most beloved games in the series! Between her giant Magitek Armor and her esper transformation, her special moves would feel *immense*.\\n\\n## Vincent (FF7)\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1514694145/Vincent_okorbz.jpg#full)\\n\\nSorry, I think I maybe said something earlier about being done with Final Fantasy 7 characters. I meant it at the time, but I'm realizing that it's not going to be much of a Final Fantasy game if we don't have any *edge*. We need you, Vincent. Your guns, your demon transformations, and yes, your completely unexplained levitation.\\n\\n## Vivi (FF9)\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1514694145/Vivi_vtqhhp.jpg#full)\\n\\nNot only is Vivi a complex and incredibly cute character, he would be the perfect representative of the series' iconic black mage design. If you ask me, it would be a bit stupid to include a black mage *other* than Vivi. ALMOST as stupid as not making a Final Fantasy musou game after 30 years! I should maybe move on now, because the longer I try and imagine Vivi in this game, the worse I feel that it doesn't exist.\\n\\n## Wakka (FFX)\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1514694145/Wakka_msgpey.jpg#full)\\n\\nThis is more than a little unconventional, so let me explain: a laidback dude that bounces sporting equipment off of his enemies' faces would add *a lot* of flavor to an otherwise sword-heavy roster. Did you know that in Hyrule Warriors, you could dress Link up in a mail man outfit while obliterating *thousands of bad dudes*? They didn't have to do that, but they did, and the game was better for it. Wakka brings our game some much-needed levity.\\n\\n## Rikku (FFX-2)\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1514694145/Rikku_orf9lc.jpg#full)\\n\\nShe's no Yuna, but Rikku has way too many character traits that make her a must-have. The dual blades from her X-2 design would be perfectly suited to a speedy playstyle. She also has an enormous number of unique special attacks that could be borrowed from her *Mix* overlimits from Final Fantasy X. Most importantly, her energetic and playful personality would balance out the series' penchant for sullen teenagers.\\n\\n## Snow (FF13)\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1514694145/Snow_sfxudt.jpg#full)\\n\\nLightning is probably the more realistic pick here, and as a Lightning fan, I'd be totally fine with that. In Snow's favor, though, a brainless beat-em-up needs a brainless guy to punch things. Snow would fill that role without a second's hesitation. He also has some kind of strange, lady-based motorcycle? That stupid bike is never going to be as useful *anywhere else* as it would be in a Dynasty Warriors game.\\n\\n## Noctis (FF15)\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1514694145/Noctis_ncxq26.jpg#full)\\n\\nAs the hero of the most recent Final Fantasy, Noctis is probably as essential a character as Cloud. That restriction aside, it's fortunately pretty easy to imagine a flashy and sastisfying moveset for our king-to-be. He has sparkly blue teleports, numerous weapons, and some spectacularly *anime* special moves. \\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\nThis is far from a complete list, but for a practical lineup of 12 characters, we could do worse! For comparison's sake, Dynasty Warriors 8 has **70+** playable characters, so maybe we still have some seats to fill.

Even if I would've restricted myself to the games I'm predisposed to like (I'm curious, so no, I didn't), it *still* would have been impossible to keep up with the sheer onslaught of games. It's inevitable that we all missed something, or more likely, a lot of \\\"somethings.\\\" In honor of all that games accomplished in 2017, I'd like to recognize a few of my favorites that deserved a little more time in the spotlight.\\n\\n## Arms\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1517441772/Arms_ghwhc5.jpg#full)\\n\\nFrom step-by-step combo challenges to replay systems and extensive tutorials, we've seen varied attempts to draw new blood to fighting games. Arms, however, is a different kind of \\\"accessible fighting game\\\" that gleans striking depth from a dead-simple foundation. Every character has (well, approximately) the same moveset: two punches, a grab, a block, a dash, and a jump. They also have inexplicably stretchy arms, varying in design from springs, to ribbons, to even...championship belts...? This game is something else, folks.\\n\\nThe thing about having long arms, though, is that they take an exceptional stretch of time to coil oooout-and-baaaack. Therein lies the core of the competitive Arms experience: exploiting the opportunities left in the dust of your opponent's punches. I'm as green of a fighter as they come, but even I was able to rapidly pick up on Arms' mindgames, strategies, and nuances. For example: punching slows your movement, which means you can *always* catch up to someone who is trying to whittle you away at a distance. A jumping opponent can't block, which leaves them vulnerable to the full damage of your rush attack. For the first time in my life, Arms allowed me to move past the \\\"double quarter circle\\\" hurdle of a traditional fighting game, and truly engage with the genre in its rich, fulfilling entirety.\\n\\n## Flywrench\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1517441769/Flywrench_evxdei.jpg#full)\\n\\nTo the cursory mind, \\\"immersion\\\" is a concept of narrative design. What details in an environment make a setting feel real? How is failure contextualized within a game's world? Flywrench, however, generally forgoes narrative and induces immersion through meticulous mechanical purity. I once described the game as having made me feel \\\"like I could catch a bullet between my fingers.\\\" *That* is the pinnacle of timing, execution, and reflexes that Flywrench pushes towards.\\n\\nFlywrench differs from most games, in that it handles with almost distressing sensitivity. A single button press carries its weight across hundreds of milliseconds, and as your momentum builds, it can take incredible care to reverse. My accident-prone human mind felt at times insufficient for this game, and *I love that about it*. Challenges whir by at hyperspeed - the very first level (in addition to many others) can be completed through ordinary play in roughly one second. Its [unrelenting pace](https://twitter.com/JackLeveledUp/status/832402368780181504) and gradual difficulty curve instill an almost *inhuman* awareness of time and motion, and that's just not an experience many other games are going to offer.\\n\\n## Shovel Knight: Spectre of Torment\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1517441769/SpectreKnight_fhasv7.jpg#full)\\n\\nConsidering Shovel Knight's booming reception when it launched in 2014, I have to admit, I'm somewhat puzzled by the muted reaction to its follow-up campaigns. In fairness, I guess March of 2017 was among the most busy months the hobby has ever seen. Nintendo launched a console, there was a new Nier, a new Zelda, a new first-party exclusive from Sony (Horizon), and a new Persona not long after. Regardless, Spectre of Torment is a game that more people should have made time for.\\n\\nAs loud as this praise might sound, I mean it: Spectre Knight's campaign is Yacht Club's most impressive work yet. More than \\\"just an expansion,\\\" it's an experience completely unlike the weighty bounces of Shovel Knight, or Plague Knight's bounding leaps. Spectre Knight zips gracefully from enemy, to obstacle, to enemy again using his signature move, the \\\"slash dash.\\\" It's an attack, a double jump, a dive kick, and a gap closer all at once, and its utilized in each and every stage with diversity and brilliance. All of that leaves out the fact that the music is inspiring and catchy, the narrative is (yet again) surprisingly affective, and it only costs $10. *Play it!*\\n\\n*...as long as we're on the subject, the [King Knight campaign](http://yachtclubgames.com/2017/08/king-of-cards/) comes out this year. I don't know, maybe you'd be interested? I'm just throwing it out there.*\\n\\n## Linelight\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1517441769/Linelight_znp1gn.jpg#full)\\n\\nIn any other year, Linelight's impeccable design sensibilities would have been more than enough to land it near the top of my Game of the Year list. It carries an enveloping sense of minimalism, not only as an aesthetic, but as a foundational design principle. I don't know, maybe there's no other way to design a puzzle game about lines? It's a triumph nonetheless. Linelight's vibrant, splashy color pallette communicates new puzzle mechanics without any need for explanation or interruption. There are some real mindbenders hidden away along optional paths, but its gentle piano melodies and energetic blips and chimes maintain a thoughtful sense of optimism and encouragement.\\n\\nGradually solving its puzzles is a meditative experience, like sitting on the beach, listening to the waves roll up to shore. In a way, though, that feels...insufficient. What makes Linelight so memorable are the moments where I discovered that the game was a little more \\\"alive\\\" than expected. For example, here's something minor that isn't much of a spoiler (by all means, skip ahead to the next paragraph if you prefer): sole developer Brett Taylor closes out the game's credits sequence with a sweet, [heartfelt message to his parents](https://twitter.com/JackLeveledUp/status/830281422057435136). There are plenty of other small touches that *are* directly experienced in the game proper, but they're neat, and probably wouldn't land the same way if I explained them in advance.\\n\\nMinimalism, when pursued to its natural ends, can often feel sterile, sometimes even lifeless. Linelight is anything but lifeless. Despite being a game about the \\\"lines\\\" sliding about predetermined paths, its human touches remind us that we aren't alone.\\n\\n## Pyre\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1517544998/Pyre_daqfdl.jpg#full)\\n\\nTo be honest, Pyre is a tough sell. As natural as the combination might be in actuality, \\\"sports\\\" and \\\"RPG\\\" are not genres that people think of as going together. Genre definitions are a fickle friend, and Pyre is far too notable of a game to skip over merely for the gameplay concepts it combines.\\n\\nWithout getting too specific, its narrative raises heavy questions: What is the cost of freedom? Who is worthy of being free, and are there those that are more worthy than others? If push came to shove, by what criteria would you choose? These themes are fully explored in visual novel segments, which are miraculously both short and effective. Obvious care has been given to ensure that each and every text box counts, and despite this ruthless efficiency, its lines carry a [powerful, poetic quality](https://twitter.com/JackLeveledUp/status/900517127752437760).\\n\\n![Pyre's fidgety goblin shopkeeper, \\\"Falcon Ron,\\\" is an obnoxious, but hilarious mess. He says: \\\"Business has been real, real good, and everything, it's just, it's been a little slow, in spots, a little slow is all, so I was thinking, maybe I should do a sale? What would you say to that?\\\"](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1517888198/Pyre_20170823231930_v82x4o.jpg)\\n\\nLike any RPG, you'll make decisions about the members of your team, the skills they use, and how to utlize them in the heat of the moment, but there are even more decisions to be made on a metanarrative level. Unlike, well, nearly every game ever made, losing a match in Pyre is not a game over. Its \\\"battles\\\" aren't life-and-death duels, but rituals along the path of liberation. It's inevitable that at some point, losing a match will become a narrative decision - and unfortunately, I *cannot* talk about why this matters without spoiling anything. Ironically, by making losses an acceptable outcome, the stakes of the rites are dramatically raised. \\n\\nThe team at Supergiant have made three games as disparate as they are exceptional, and if you ask me, Pyre is easily my favorite of the bunch. It takes so many risks: in genre, in narrative, in structure, and especially in its politics. Now, I realize I've been vague, and I can't promise that each and every one of those gambles will pay off for everyone. The least I can do is urge you to give it a chance, if only to see for yourself how *different* of a game it is.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<p>Our backlogs have never been bigger than the monstrous sizes they swelled to in the past year.

Even if I would've restricted myself to the games I'm predisposed\nto like (I'm curious, so no, I didn't), it still  would have been impossible to\nkeep up with the sheer onslaught of games. It's inevitable that we all missed\nsomething, or more likely, a lot of \"somethings.\" In honor of all that games\naccomplished in 2017, I'd like to recognize a few of my favorites that deserved\na little more time in the spotlight.\n\nArms\n\n\nFrom step-by-step combo challenges to replay systems and extensive tutorials,\nwe've seen varied attempts to draw new blood to fighting games. Arms, however,\nis a different kind of \"accessible fighting game\" that gleans striking depth\nfrom a dead-simple foundation. Every character has (well, approximately) the\nsame moveset: two punches, a grab, a block, a dash, and a jump. They also have\ninexplicably stretchy arms, varying in design from springs, to ribbons, to\neven...championship belts...? This game is something else, folks.\n\nThe thing about having long arms, though, is that they take an exceptional\nstretch of time to coil oooout-and-baaaack. Therein lies the core of the\ncompetitive Arms experience: exploiting the opportunities left in the dust of\nyour opponent's punches. I'm as green of a fighter as they come, but even I was\nable to rapidly pick up on Arms' mindgames, strategies, and nuances. For\nexample: punching slows your movement, which means you can always  catch up to\nsomeone who is trying to whittle you away at a distance. A jumping opponent\ncan't block, which leaves them vulnerable to the full damage of your rush\nattack. For the first time in my life, Arms allowed me to move past the \"double\nquarter circle\" hurdle of a traditional fighting game, and truly engage with the\ngenre in its rich, fulfilling entirety.\n\nFlywrench\n\n\nTo the cursory mind, \"immersion\" is a concept of narrative design. What details\nin an environment make a setting feel real? How is failure contextualized within\na game's world? Flywrench, however, generally forgoes narrative and induces\nimmersion through meticulous mechanical purity. I once described the game as\nhaving made me feel \"like I could catch a bullet between my fingers.\" That  is\nthe pinnacle of timing, execution, and reflexes that Flywrench pushes towards.\n\nFlywrench differs from most games, in that it handles with almost distressing\nsensitivity. A single button press carries its weight across hundreds of\nmilliseconds, and as your momentum builds, it can take incredible care to\nreverse. My accident-prone human mind felt at times insufficient for this game,\nand I love that about it. Challenges whir by at hyperspeed - the very first\nlevel (in addition to many others) can be completed through ordinary play in\nroughly one second. Its unrelenting pace\n[https://twitter.com/JackLeveledUp/status/832402368780181504]  and gradual\ndifficulty curve instill an almost inhuman  awareness of time and motion, and\nthat's just not an experience many other games are going to offer.\n\nShovel Knight: Spectre of Torment\n\n\nConsidering Shovel Knight's booming reception when it launched in 2014, I have\nto admit, I'm somewhat puzzled by the muted reaction to its follow-up campaigns.\nIn fairness, I guess March of 2017 was among the most busy months the hobby has\never seen. Nintendo launched a console, there was a new Nier, a new Zelda, a new\nfirst-party exclusive from Sony (Horizon), and a new Persona not long after.\nRegardless, Spectre of Torment is a game that more people should have made time\nfor.\n\nAs loud as this praise might sound, I mean it: Spectre Knight's campaign is\nYacht Club's most impressive work yet. More than \"just an expansion,\" it's an\nexperience completely unlike the weighty bounces of Shovel Knight, or Plague\nKnight's bounding leaps. Spectre Knight zips gracefully from enemy, to obstacle,\nto enemy again using his signature move, the \"slash dash.\" It's an attack, a\ndouble jump, a dive kick, and a gap closer all at once, and its utilized in each\nand every stage with diversity and brilliance. All of that leaves out the fact\nthat the music is inspiring and catchy, the narrative is (yet again)\nsurprisingly affective, and it only costs $10. Play it!\n\n...as long as we're on the subject, the King Knight campaign\n[http://yachtclubgames.com/2017/08/king-of-cards/]  comes out this year. I don't\nknow, maybe you'd be interested? I'm just throwing it out there.\n\nLinelight\n\n\nIn any other year, Linelight's impeccable design sensibilities would have been\nmore than enough to land it near the top of my Game of the Year list. It carries\nan enveloping sense of minimalism, not only as an aesthetic, but as a\nfoundational design principle. I don't know, maybe there's no other way to\ndesign a puzzle game about lines?

Most notably, it was a time of renaissance for Japanese developers, where even the most established of series took bold, genre-shifting leaps forward. I've been making game of the year lists since 2013, but this year marks the first time that I've thrown one together while still actively playing *every game on it*. It's even more impressive when you think about how long it's taken me to write this! But I digress - out of all of the games I played last year, here are the three that I liked best:\\n\\n## 3. Monolith\\n![The player's ship, \\\"Null,\\\" narrowly dodges a lightning barrage from an imposing machine boss.](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1521128893/monolith_iwyjoi.jpg#full)\\n\\nIn today's gaming ecosystem, I seem to find myself jumping from one giant adventure to the next; always searching for meaning in another bespoke fantasy setting. Having recognized this pattern, I've learned to make time for smaller experiences to balance out my diet, often in the form of artistically-driven indie projects. It's for that reason that I tried out [Monolith](https://team-d-13.itch.io/monolith), a small-scale roguelite shmup with charming pixel art. Honestly, I think I'm still feeling whiplash from how quickly it went from mere distraction to main attraction.\\n\\nIf it's not obvious at a glance, this peculiar cocktail of genre and progression systems is immaculate. Shmups are, inherently, at least a *little* vexing: their campaigns crawl forward relentlessly, as wave after predetermined wave of enemies assault from all directions. Their path to mastery is riddled with technical minutiae, memorization, and divine execution. Monolith, unlike most shmups, arranges challenges into randomly assembled Zelda-like dungeons, in which it's impossible to know what enemies lie around the next corner. Weapons, ammo, and upgrades litter each floor as you hunt down mini-bosses, which act as the \\\"keys\\\" that unlock the next main boss. This structure arguably guides the player into comparable skill bottlenecks, but it does so gently, maybe even invisibly. I didn't set out expecting to become proficient at shmups, but in the process of playing a few runs, I subconsciously honed my reflexes into something resembling actual skill.\\n\\nFor an $8 game, the depths of this dungeon are staggering. I've been banging my head against the same boss for [some time now](https://twitter.com/JackLeveledUp/status/974473791194697728), yet I still find myself eagerly coming back week after week. Every run feels like it could be \\\"the one,\\\" and I'm still finding joy in the unique ways they play out. Making a game so fun to play is an achievement in and of itself, but something that's fun and surprising *even when losing* is a rare treat.\\n\\n\\n## 2. Persona 5\\n![Three of the main characters, Ren, Ryuji, and Ann, pass through the Shibuya crossing on a sunny spring day.](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1521055726/persona5_ushrcx.jpg#full)\\n\\nIn its opening seconds, Persona 5 makes its presence known by screaming out in vibrant red, white, and black, over the jazz organ and funk bass of [Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lswcZg7BH2M). \\\"Take your mask off and be free,\\\" the vocals cry, as the main cast make Tokyo their playground, soaring between rooftops and figure skating down highways. These motifs are reflected in every facet of the 100+ hour experience, creating what is without a doubt one of the most stylish games ever made.\\n\\nIt's a story about outcasts, identity, and civil unrest, and while the expression of those ideas can be clumsy at times, it resonates in spite of its occasional fumbles. In Persona 5, complacency is *literally* a prison. Our colorful cast of teenagers make use of \\\"Personas,\\\" the fantastical representation of their self-confidence, to break free from the shackles of society. They take on the guise of \\\"Phantom Thieves,\\\" and set out to reclaim their future from their oppressors.\\n\\nEach villain is confronted in a \\\"palace,\\\" an alternate reality where their perceptions are made manifest. For example, a prosecutor becomes so disillusioned with their job that they see criminal justice as a gamble, transforming a courtroom into an opulent casino. These environments are impeccably designed, at once providing unconventional backdrops for RPG combat and fulfilling the thief's fantasy of pulling a heist.\\n\\n![The Phantom Thief \\\"Skull,\\\" dressed in black leather and an iron monkey-skull mask, unloads his shotgun on a vulnerable demon.](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1521055726/persona5-2_takywl.jpg#full)\\n\\nWhat excites me most about Persona 5 aren't even its major thematics (as impressive as it may be to fight the embodiment of all human apathy) - it's the dazzling flourish put into every detail imaginable. From all-out attacks, to leaping into hiding, to simply opening a menu, every action has a unique animation that overflows with energy. The soundtrack takes on a life of its own, using sullen grooves like [\\\"Mementos\\\"](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/mementos/1226945984?i=1226946509) to turn a dungeon crawl into a dungeon transgression. It all feels so *excessively* cool, like some kind of wild Platinum Games x Studio Trigger collaboration of an RPG. Persona 5 is so aesthetically fascinating that it's worth dipping into, even if only for the spectacle.\\n\\n## 1. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\\n![Link stands near a cliff's edge, overlooking the green fields and blue skies of Hyrule. Calamity Gannon's dark magic has corrupted the distant Hyrule Castle, causing inky, black slime to surround its base, and swirling red energy to circle its towers.](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1521079831/zelda-botw-1_naxqg3.jpg#full)\\n\\nIt would be hard to find some form of praise that hasn't already been heaped onto Breath of the Wild, so in a sense, it's not surprising at all that it's claiming a place at the top of this list. On the other hand, sometimes it goes unsaid how phenomenally enduring Zelda has been throughout video game history. Not only has Zelda remained prominent for 30 years, it's responsible for the *most acclaimed game* in one of the *best years of games* ever. In my eyes, Breath of the Wild's praise is earned in how endlessly rewarding it is to explore.\\n\\nEvery hill, valley, lake, and shrine feels like it's holding its own secret treasure. That \\\"treasure\\\" could be anything: a new weapon, a clever puzzle, an incredible view, or maybe just the experience brought out by some extraordinary circumstance. *Something* is going to happen wherever you go, and more than that, you're immediately given all you need to go anywhere you want. You're set free to visit Hyrule in your own way, whether that's trailblazing straight to the final fight with Calamity Gannon, finding all 120 shrines and 900 korok seeds, or what I did: simply adventuring, wherever it happened to take me.\\n\\n![Link, carrying a large battle axe, solves a stacking-block puzzle by placing an iron cube in the correct position between other stone cubes.](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1521079830/zelda-botw-2_rlujtm.jpg#full)\\n\\nEven my frustrations and hardships have become fond memories, like trials I overcame, rather than flaws in the game design. One of my most memorable \\\"battles\\\" was when I found an enemy encampment at the base of a small mountain, and I was sorely lacking for weapons. I decided to keep my distance and approach from behind the summit. I began by lobbing a single bomb down the slope, taking out the nearest Bokoblin while throwing the rest of the camp into confused panic. So, with few other realistic options, I stayed out of sight and went bowling, rolling down bomb after bomb until no survivors were left. Later, I was struggling against a boss, so I decided to back down and take some time to prepare. I put on my sneaking gear, crafted some potions to make me move quickly, and crept through Hyrule Castle, looting out the enemy's strongest arsenal. I crushed the boss by the time I got back, but what's more important is that I was able to twist my struggle into something new and exciting. Every inconvenience I faced, I countered with a plan, and win or lose, that plan would go on to become a one-of-a-kind story.\\n\\nAn adventure worth having can only take place in a setting worth exploring, and the beauty of this game's world is never more apparent than in its softest moments. Even now, these vague rumblings of recollection are enough to yank me back to Hyrule. I remember once running across a beach towards a mysterious shrine, when I happened to turn the camera to the tallest mountain in the kingdom. The warm, coral rays of the setting sun were scattered across the peak's jagged edges, shaping a powerful silhouette out of an iron shield, the Master Sword, and the brave warrior who held them. It wasn't even one of those \\\"oh wow, that's gorgeous\\\" impulses, where your thumb instinctually smashes the screenshot button. I just...stopped. I paused to reflect on how impossibly far I had come: the challenges I'd surpassed, the distance I'd crossed, and each of the many other stunning vistas I had seen before. It was through countless, beautiful scenes like this that I realized that perhaps an *imperceptible* amount of craftsmanship went into this setting. I mean, games have stunning sunsets, that's a fact, but this one felt \\\"accidental.\\\" It felt special; it felt like *my sunset*. I did eventually realize I should take a screenshot, and it's become my most prized souvenir from my vacation in Hyrule.\\n\\n![The sun sets behind the distant Death Mountain, and Link's body is silhouette against the fading, coral light of the sun.](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1521079831/zelda-botw-4_z7orte.jpg#full)\\n\\nThere was a point where I began to see the coming end, and my dread became so strong that I actually made myself stop playing. What would I do after I had seen it all? How many more ridiculous battle plans would I be able to devise and pull off? By now, I know better than to expect to ever find *everything*. There's always going to be a \\\"next time\\\" in Breath of the Wild, whether it's something I overlooked, or some scenario I couldn't possibly have predicted. I don't have a clue where I'll go next, but I'm sure I'll figure something out, and it'll be worth it when I get there.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<p>We've been saying it over and over, but that doesn't make it any less true: 2017 was an exceptional year for video games.

Most notably, it was a time of\nrenaissance for Japanese developers, where even the most established of series\ntook bold, genre-shifting leaps forward. I've been making game of the year lists\nsince 2013, but this year marks the first time that I've thrown one together\nwhile still actively playing every game on it. It's even more impressive when\nyou think about how long it's taken me to write this! But I digress - out of all\nof the games I played last year, here are the three that I liked best:\n\n3. Monolith\n\n\nIn today's gaming ecosystem, I seem to find myself jumping from one giant\nadventure to the next; always searching for meaning in another bespoke fantasy\nsetting. Having recognized this pattern, I've learned to make time for smaller\nexperiences to balance out my diet, often in the form of artistically-driven\nindie projects. It's for that reason that I tried out Monolith\n[https://team-d-13.itch.io/monolith], a small-scale roguelite shmup with\ncharming pixel art. Honestly, I think I'm still feeling whiplash from how\nquickly it went from mere distraction to main attraction.\n\nIf it's not obvious at a glance, this peculiar cocktail of genre and progression\nsystems is immaculate. Shmups are, inherently, at least a little  vexing: their\ncampaigns crawl forward relentlessly, as wave after predetermined wave of\nenemies assault from all directions. Their path to mastery is riddled with\ntechnical minutiae, memorization, and divine execution. Monolith, unlike most\nshmups, arranges challenges into randomly assembled Zelda-like dungeons, in\nwhich it's impossible to know what enemies lie around the next corner. Weapons,\nammo, and upgrades litter each floor as you hunt down mini-bosses, which act as\nthe \"keys\" that unlock the next main boss. This structure arguably guides the\nplayer into comparable skill bottlenecks, but it does so gently, maybe even\ninvisibly. I didn't set out expecting to become proficient at shmups, but in the\nprocess of playing a few runs, I subconsciously honed my reflexes into something\nresembling actual skill.\n\nFor an $8 game, the depths of this dungeon are staggering. I've been banging my\nhead against the same boss for some time now\n[https://twitter.com/JackLeveledUp/status/974473791194697728], yet I still find\nmyself eagerly coming back week after week. Every run feels like it could be\n\"the one,\" and I'm still finding joy in the unique ways they play out. Making a\ngame so fun to play is an achievement in and of itself, but something that's fun\nand surprising even when losing  is a rare treat.\n\n2. Persona 5\n\n\nIn its opening seconds, Persona 5 makes its presence known by screaming out in\nvibrant red, white, and black, over the jazz organ and funk bass of Wake Up,\nGet\nUp, Get Out There [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lswcZg7BH2M]. \"Take your mask\noff and be free,\" the vocals cry, as the main cast make Tokyo their playground,\nsoaring between rooftops and figure skating down highways. These motifs are\nreflected in every facet of the 100+ hour experience, creating what is without a\ndoubt one of the most stylish games ever made.\n\nIt's a story about outcasts, identity, and civil unrest, and while the\nexpression of those ideas can be clumsy at times, it resonates in spite of its\noccasional fumbles. In Persona 5, complacency is literally  a prison. Our\ncolorful cast of teenagers make use of \"Personas,\" the fantastical\nrepresentation of their self-confidence, to break free from the shackles of\nsociety. They take on the guise of \"Phantom Thieves,\" and set out to reclaim\ntheir future from their oppressors.\n\nEach villain is confronted in a \"palace,\" an alternate reality where their\nperceptions are made manifest. For example, a prosecutor becomes so\ndisillusioned with their job that they see criminal justice as a gamble,\ntransforming a courtroom into an opulent casino. These environments are\nimpeccably designed, at once providing unconventional backdrops for RPG combat\nand fulfilling the thief's fantasy of pulling a heist.\n\n\n\nWhat excites me most about Persona 5 aren't even its major thematics (as\nimpressive as it may be to fight the embodiment of all human apathy) - it's the\ndazzling flourish put into every detail imaginable. From all-out attacks, to\nleaping into hiding, to simply opening a menu, every action has a unique\nanimation that overflows with energy. The soundtrack takes on a life of its own,\nusing sullen grooves like \"Mementos\"\n[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/mementos/1226945984?i=1226946509]  to turn a\ndungeon crawl into a dungeon transgression. It all feels so excessively  cool,\nlike some kind of wild Platinum Games x Studio Trigger collaboration of an RPG.\nPersona 5 is so aesthetically fascinating that it's worth dipping into, even if\nonly for the spectacle.\n\n1. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\n\n\nIt would be hard to find some form of praise that hasn't already been heaped\nonto Breath of the Wild, so in a sense, it's not surprising at all that it's\nclaiming a place at the top of this list.

From the pilot alone, though, it seems to be one that director Masashi Ishihama (of the excellent *From the New World*) and A-1 Studios are prepared for. For one, the character art and expressions are well-drawn: surprisingly detailed, and highly consistent from shot-to-shot. The scene compositions and color palette perfectly match the game's vivid aesthetic, and the animation is powerful, fast, and fluid. The most impressive part of this pilot, though, and the reason it's worth watching for fans and newcomers alike, are its dashes of fresh thematic flavor.\\n\\nJust like the game, episode one hits the ground running as the Phantom Thieves shake down a lavish casino. While the runtime of this scene is (inevitably) condensed, it somehow manages to skate by with a notable addition. At the very start of the escape, our protagonist, \\\"Joker,\\\" shares a dramatic moment with \\\"Crow\\\" that plants the seeds of a future narrative payoff.\\n\\n![The silhouette of \\\"Crow,\\\" one of the Phantom Thieves, as he stands confidently poised with pistol in hand](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1523226040/p5-animation-akechi_be3rvu.jpg#full)\\n\\nJoker needs a distraction to get away with the goods - so the team has Crow shoot down the support cable of a massive chandelier. His bullet zings directly past Joker's face, emphasizing the wild, youthful recklessness that defines the Phantom Thieves. With the casino in chaos, Joker begins his acrobatic escape while the rest of the Thieves chatter gleefully over voice communication. Crow boasts, \\\"You guys can praise my marksmanship, if you like.\\\" He is not obliged.\\n\\nLater, we're shown an all-original scene where Ren (the canonical name of the protagonist, apparently) first arrives in Tokyo. He's on a train, awareness fading in and out as he attempts to recall the night that led to his recent expulsion. While it doesn't really...*explain* anything, it's an economical piece of framing for the story to come. It's an extensive effort, honestly: next, Ren overhears some girls gushing about \\\"Akechi,\\\" a prodigy detective that plays a major role in the story. Another original scene follows, this time foreshadowing Ren's persona, Arsene, and the \\\"strange app\\\" that leads Ren to the shadow world. I'd be curious what a first-timer makes of this rapid-fire sequence, but given my experience with the game, I was more than impressed with what Shinichi Inotsume has pieced together. All of this is foreshadowing that the original game lacked, or at the very least, was less than explicit in its mandatory cutscenes. \\n\\n![Time seems to freeze as Ren enters the famous Shibuya scramble. His surroundings turn red, and sees a powerful, blue, being in the distance. It gazes back, then disappears.](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1523225353/p5-animation-ep1-2_wan89v.jpg#full)\\n\\nMy favorite scene in this episode is the introduction of Ann, a future member of the Phantom Thieves. Ren's walk to his new school is brought to a halt by pouring rain. He seeks shelter under a storefront awning, where he makes brief eye contact with another Shujin Academy student, Ann. As the soul-stirring [\\\"Meeting\\\"](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/meeting/1226945984?i=1226946000) by Shoji Meguro swells, Ann plucks a wayward cherry petal out of Ren's hair. At first, I questioned this detail as needless fan service, but the lines that followed caught me off guard.\\n\\n\\\"I hate the rain,\\\" Ann laments, gazing first at the clouds, then back down to the petal. \\\"It scatters the pretty blossoms everywhere.\\\" \\n\\n![Ann pauses in contemplation after plucking a cherry petal from Ren's hair](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1523226040/p5-animation-ann_afydjz.jpg#full)\\n\\nYet again, we've been blessed with Inotsume's writing efficiency. This line has a dual-purpose: first, it utilizes Ann's introduction to establish her characteristic assertiveness. Even more importantly, it adds further to the now-heaping pile of thematic groundwork. It's *supposed* to be one of the most beautiful times of year, yet the rain pounds down relentlessly. If it's not apparent already: this episode is telling us that \\\"injustice\\\" is going to be a key element of Persona 5's plot line. Ann's petal-pluck is a thoughtful, natural extension of her character that gives this one-off scene long-term narrative relevance.\\n\\nProduction issues not withstanding, if anything will do *Persona 5: The Animation* in, it'll be trying to tell too much story in not enough time. We can arguably find some examples of that in this pilot, although maybe that's the price to be paid for animating such a massive game. Nonetheless, A-1 Studios have done an excellent job of teeing up what's to come, and at times, it may even be more coherent than the original source material. This team clearly understands the nuances of Persona 5's characters and narrative, and I can't wait to see what other clever additions they'll make in the coming weeks.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<p>As an adaptation of a 100+ hour game, <em>Persona 5: The Animation</em> has started  down a long, arduous path.

Marketing cycles are well-oiled machines: delicate assemblies of deliberately timed trailers, content updates, and sales promotions. That cycle prompts all manner of takes and responses from fans, journalists, developers, competitors, and video producers, all vying over the same air supply on social media. It can often feel like we need to earn our personal value by conceiving Valuable Thoughts and unleashing them, moment-by-moment, onto social media. And even if we resist, even if we know that's not true, that pressure remains. It's human. In the era of brand-building and consumption, can a game developer afford to keep a secret? Lest they forfeit the never-ending, bare-knuckle brawl for attention?\\n\\nIt sounds bleak, huh? There are some highly specific aspects of this, at least, that aren't entirely bad. For example: the prevalence of streams, along with our modern video-content-mill, helps us understand the \\\"play experience\\\" of games earlier and more fully than we ever have before. We can connect with people across the world over the games we like, and cross-reference our feelings with them to broaden our horizons, learn more about our own tastes, and hopefully spend our \\\"entertainment dollars\\\" more wisely. Aside from social media, surprises in games have been somewhat eroded by development of *the craft*.

Like our player character, Madeline, he heads to the exalted Mount Celeste for some honest soul searching. She bumps into Theo throughout the story, where he'll offer advice, comeradie, and crucial moral support. He's a laidback dude! There's a lot more to him than meets the eye, though: if you find him in a secret room in the very first level of the game, he'll tell you about how he came to Mount Celeste, his recent burnout in the American professional wasteland, and his new passion: his \\\"InstaPix\\\" account. He urges you to check it out - a not-so-subtle hint that he's talking about [a *real* Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/theounderstars/)!\\n\\nTo say the least, I was knocked to my feet when I found this in my very first session with the game. Celeste adorns the guise of a traditional, 2D platformer, a genre that typically has more to do with level design & mechanics than narrative. As I scrolled through Theo's Instagram, I unravelled a history that extended beyond the scope of the game. I traced the events that led Theo to Mount Celeste, reading every caption, and taking note of the dates on every post. This type of narrative context is incredibly difficult to weave into a platformer naturally, but on a social network that I was already comfortable with? I couldn't get enough. Theo became more than a supporting character in a game, he was this cool cartoon guy from Seattle that I had to follow.\\n\\n![Theo takes a minute to rest near the base of Mount Celeste, alongside a campfire and the aging wreckage of an airplane.](https://res.cloudinary.com/levelplusone/image/upload/v1537330965/celeste-theo_kweybu.jpg#full)\\n\\nIn the months following Celeste's release, Theo has continued to post updates, providing fans with closure to the story and nice, little reminders of our time with the game. And when it was revealed that Madeline would be making her appearance in Towerfall, he even posted a picture of her [practicing with her bow](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnB1mxbhU0A/?taken-by=theounderstars). It's a small, warm little surprise - like hearing from an old friend after some time apart. Theo's posts may all be comic-style drawings, but their presence in our own social spaces make him feel almost as real as anyone else. We're all out here somewhere, doing our best, documenting our struggles, and celebrating our triumphs. And if Theo was able to get through it? I don't know, maybe the rest of us can, too.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<p>There's a common refrain in fandom that <em>games just don't have as many surprises as they used to.</em> I get it - it's easy to feel that way! Marketing cycles are well-oiled machines: delicate assemblies of deliberately timed trailers, content updates, and sales promotions. That cycle prompts all manner of takes and responses from fans, journalists, developers, competitors, and video producers, all vying over the same air supply on social media. It can often feel like we need to earn our personal value by conceiving Valuable Thoughts and unleashing them, moment-by-moment, onto social media. And even if we resist, even if we know that's not true, that pressure remains. It's human. In the era of brand-building and consumption, can a game developer afford to keep a secret? Lest they forfeit the never-ending, bare-knuckle brawl for attention?</p>\n<p>It sounds bleak, huh? There are some highly specific aspects of this, at least, that aren't entirely bad. For example: the prevalence of streams, along with our modern video-content-mill, helps us understand the &quot;play experience&quot; of games earlier and more fully than we ever have before. We can connect with people across the world over the games we like, and cross-reference our feelings with them to broaden our horizons, learn more about our own tastes, and hopefully spend our &quot;entertainment dollars&quot; more wisely. Aside from social media, surprises in games have been somewhat eroded by development of <em>the craft</em>. Advancements in game design, usability, interface design, and accessibility have cleared away even more of the fog around what was once hidden away.</p>\n<p>Even still, it's hard to overstate the excitement of being caught by something you never would've expected.

I get it - it's easy to feel that way! Marketing cycles are\nwell-oiled machines: delicate assemblies of deliberately timed trailers, content\nupdates, and sales promotions. That cycle prompts all manner of takes and\nresponses from fans, journalists, developers, competitors, and video producers,\nall vying over the same air supply on social media. It can often feel like we\nneed to earn our personal value by conceiving Valuable Thoughts and unleashing\nthem, moment-by-moment, onto social media. And even if we resist, even if we\nknow that's not true, that pressure remains. It's human. In the era of\nbrand-building and consumption, can a game developer afford to keep a secret?\nLest they forfeit the never-ending, bare-knuckle brawl for attention?\n\nIt sounds bleak, huh? There are some highly specific aspects of this, at least,\nthat aren't entirely bad. For example: the prevalence of streams, along with our\nmodern video-content-mill, helps us understand the \"play experience\" of games\nearlier and more fully than we ever have before. We can connect with people\nacross the world over the games we like, and cross-reference our feelings with\nthem to broaden our horizons, learn more about our own tastes, and hopefully\nspend our \"entertainment dollars\" more wisely. Aside from social media,\nsurprises in games have been somewhat eroded by development of the craft.\nAdvancements in game design, usability, interface design, and accessibility have\ncleared away even more of the fog around what was once hidden away.\n\nEven still, it's hard to overstate the excitement of being caught by something\nyou never would've expected. So how do you sneak something cool in your game\nwithout compromising its promotion? There's one particular strategy that I've\nbeen seeing more and more of, and although it's often just a small thing, I'm\nextremely into the idea:\n\ndump your food dump your food dump your food dump your food dump your food dump\nyour food dump your food dump your food\n\n— trash king (@BkTrashking) February 16, 2013\n[https://twitter.com/BkTrashking/status/302582128653262848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nYou see that? You're looking at tomorrow's metanarrative storytelling, baby.\n\n\n\nThat odd tweet probably doesn't mean anything to you right now, but it stems\nfrom Donut County [http://donutcounty.com/], an abundantly bizarre\nKatamari-like. On the surface, it's a game about, uh, sucking an entire county\ninto a hole in the ground, but a lot of its quirkiness comes from its\ncontemporary writing style. Story scenes often play out through instant message\nconversations, and even when they don't, the things the characters say sound \nlike things that would show up in your notifications. But that's not faint\npraise! Donut County knows its audience well enough that the characters feel\nfriendly right out the gate.\n\nWith that familiar tone in mind, it's perfectly fitting that BK, the raccoon\ncharacter that's always fiddling with his phone, has a real-world Twitter\naccount [https://twitter.com/BkTrashking]. I mean, he hasn't done anything\nuseful with it (have any of us...?). There's nothing plot-consequential on it,\nbut somehow, the fact that it exists gives the character gravity. He has posts\nfrom years before any of us even knew who he was! Maybe someday he'll post again\nafter we've moved on to other games. As silly and as slight as it may be, it's\nbelievable details like this that ultimately make characters feel real.\n\nThis isn't a technique that Donut County invented, obviously. To name a few: we\nsaw a notable (but very spoilery!) example from last year's biggest indie\nsurprise, and recently, Marvel's Spider-Man\n[https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/11/17845812/spider-man-ps4-twitter-tweets] \npulled social media into the game diegetically. My favorite example, though,\nwithout a doubt, is an extensive easter egg from earlier this year in Celeste.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/Bel2WbllrRx/?utm_source=ig_embed_loading]    Me and my new BFF Madeline!\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/Bel2WbllrRx/?utm_source=ig_embed_loading]\n\nA post shared by Theo\n[https://www.instagram.com/theounderstars/?utm_source=ig_embed_loading] \n(@theounderstars) on Jan 30, 2018 at 3:04pm PST\n\nThis is Theo.
