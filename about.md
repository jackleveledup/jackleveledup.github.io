Let's start with what you already know: Level+1 is a blog about games, anime, and the culture and politics around them.

Our goal is to reflect on our own unique relationships with the things we "consume," and the lessons we learn through characters, narratives, allegories, and systems. We want to foster a conscientious environment that *interprets*, not dictates, the effectiveness of narrative and design decisions.

Most importantly, we believe in art's unique ability to affect us. The games we play and the shows we watch are more than ways of passing time - they're strides along an endless road of opportunities to grow: as critics, as creators, and as people.

Level+1 is a personal project designed, developed, and written by [@JackLeveledUp](https://twitter.com/jackleveledup).
