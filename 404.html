	<p class="error-description">The website is fidgeting around oddly. It's attempting to do... hmmm... something? The meaning of its movements escapes you.</p>

	<p>You deliberate your course of action:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/"><strong>I leave it be.</strong></a> I have other matters to attend to.</li>
		<li><a href="/"><strong>I gently pat the website.</strong></a> It's okay. I know you're trying.</li>
		<li><a href="/"><strong>I sprint the other way. Far.</strong></a> No...how can this be? None of this is right!</li>
	</ul>
